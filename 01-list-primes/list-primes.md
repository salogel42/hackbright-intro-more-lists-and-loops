List Exercises 2
=====================
*Write the code for these problems in a file called `list_primes.py` inside of the `01-list-primes` directory of this repository.*

1. Create a list called `primes` and fill it with the first two prime numbers. Hint: a prime number is a positive number that is not divisible by anything except 1 and itself.
2. Try to add the next prime number to the `primes` list by typing `primes + 5`.  What happens? 
3. If you got an error, what does this error mean?
4. Commit your code.
4. Fix the error (if you got one), so that 5 will be added to the list.
5. Use the statement `primes.append(7,11)` to add the next two prime numbers to the primes list. What happens?
6. If you got an error, what does this error mean?
7. Use the statement `primes.append([7,11])` to add the next two prime numbers to the primes list. What happens? (Hint: you may have to print primes to see)
8. Use the `.pop()` method on primes to remove this erroneous entry.
9. Commit your code.
9. Fix the above statement and the `.append()` method twice to properly add 7 and 11 to the primes list.
10. Use the statement `primes.extend(13,17)` to add the next two prime numbers to the primes list. What happens? 
11. If you got an error, what does this error mean?
12. Use the statement `primes.extend(13,17)` to add the next two prime numbers to the primes list. What happens? 
13. Fix the above statement to properly use the `.extend()` method to add 13 and 17 to the list.

*** A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
